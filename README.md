# Password Generator

## Purpose

As an employee with access to sensitive data, it is very convenient to have
a random password generator that meets certain criteria so that anyone can
quickly create a new strong password that provides greater security.

This application gives the user options to:

* Specify the password length (8-128 characters)

* Include lowercase and/or uppercase letters

* Include numeric characters

* Include special characters

Upon selecting all the options, a password is generated based on the user's responses.
